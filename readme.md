# Node Intro Demo

## The Most Hello World Program Ever!

See `MostHelloWorld.js` - demonstrate creating a node project (npm init).
It prints out to console, very exciting.

## Javascript is Dynamically Typed

Then go on to briefly introduce Dynamic Typing, at least as far as Node/JS is concerned:
* Variables Do Not Have a Type at Declaration.
* Types are Inferred by usage
* Variables _do_ have a type, but that type can be changed at runtime
* Variables can be "coerced" into a different type! (This implicit type conversion is where most of the 'wat' comes from in javascript...)

See `ItsDynamic.js` for a short demo of this.
