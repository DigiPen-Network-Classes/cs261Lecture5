# "JavaScript is Weird"
Code that accompanies lecture 5 and 7 from CS 261, introducing JavaScript and Node to C++ programmers.
Various notes as I have time to update them.

# Node Intro Demo

# Hello World Wide Web

Example Web App Server using Express. It doesn't do anything, but is quite verbose.

# Hello World Wide Web but Cleaner

Same Web App Server, but now with anonymous functions!

# TCP Server from CS 260

Well, not really, but the core parts of it anyway.

# Javascript is Dynamically Typed

Then go on to briefly introduce Dynamic Typing, at least as far as Node/JS is concerned:
* Variables Do Not Have a Type at Declaration.
* Types are Inferred by usage
* Variables _do_ have a type, but that type can be changed at runtime
* Variables can be "coerced" into a different type! (This implicit type conversion is where most of the 'wat' comes from in javascript...)
